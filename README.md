Solving Sudoku puzzles with Image Processing and Machine Learning

## Motivation 
This project was created for purposes of learning image processing using OpenCV framework and learning how to create & use a convolutional neural network. 
This project aims to solve any given 9x9 sudoku puzzle and return user the solution for the given puzzle grid.

## Current status
This project is still under development.
